# Welcome to Costas project's Library
The aim of this library is to support the study and analysis of long-term variable stars; the ones that are characterized by long-term flux variations on time scales of many years or various decades, and small amplitudes in visual flux.

## Modules
The modules are divided in 2 large groups: Detection and Classification.
### Detection
Here we found the tools for [data acquisition](datadq.md), with the objective of parse the light curve's data; [Preprocessing](preprocessing.md), where remove non-eligible stars by position and magnitude can be done, also remove outlier values from light curves; [features extraction](features.md), wich is usefull for statistics and curve fit; and [selection](selection.md), extracting only the long-term variable stars.
### Classifications
